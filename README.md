# Tutor-Fellows
201 Culminating Project


# Why We Built Our App
* Wanted to create an app where students in need of help can be matched with tutors that meet their criteria and needs.

#Basic Function
* User inputs information on our register page, which is persisted thru local storage. Then user information is compared with tutor information. The site compiles list of tutors that match the user's inputs. Each tutor is interactive by displaying their weekly availability, in a visual format.

#User Stories
##As a Developer:
* As a developer, I would want to build an app that is clear, informative and easy to navigate.
* As a developer, I would like to create a function that compares the studentâ€™s information that they inputed with each tutor, then selects the best match for the student.
* As a developer, I would like to create a constructor that streamlines adding new students. The constructor will hold attributes specific to what the user inputs.

##As a User :
* As a user, I would like to find qualified tutor in my area of study.
* As a user, I would like a site that is easy to navigate that I can get to where I want in as few clicks as possible.
* As a user, I want a sit that is interesting to look at and has a good color scheme.
* As a user, I want to see the availability of all tutors to compare to my own.

##As Code Fellows:
* As an umbrella organization to this new website, I want to ensure that the content and design reflects our mission and professionalism.
* If our students (former and current) will be using this application, we want to ensure that it promotes the integrity of our business and our clients (students).
* As an educational body, we seek to ensure that the final product will represent the level at which we teach by holding it to a high standard of excellence.
